  Measure of Skewness and Kurtosis
	Skewness
		Karl Pearson Coefficient of Skewness: 0.4367
			Here, Skp > 0.
			Therefore, The given frequency distribution is positively skewed.
		Bowley's Coefficient of Skewness: 0.5116
			Here, Skb > 0.
			Therefore, The given frequency distribution is positively skewed.
	Coefficient of Skewness based upon moments
		β₁: 0.0090
		𝛄₁: 0.0949
			Here, 𝛄₁ > 0.
			Therefore, The distribution is positively skewed.
	Coefficient of Kurtosis
		β₂: 2.3439
		𝛄₂: -0.6561
			Here, 𝛄₁ < 0.
			Therefore, The distribution is Platykurtic.
