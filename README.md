<h1 align="center">A Statistical Data Analysis Project</h1>

This project, undertaken during my second semester, was a thrilling challenge in logic building and independent data analysis. I aimed to create a program using C language that analyzed data using statistical methods. It proved to be an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to delve into C concepts, improve my current understanding of it and explore their application in practical scenarios.

<h3 align="left">Key Learnings:</h3>

- **Precision Matters:** I initially used floating-point numbers (floats) for calculations, but discovered their limitations in precision for real-world applications. This led to minor inaccuracies.  Switching to more precise data types ensured reliable results. 
- **Flexible Logic for Diverse Calculations:**  My initial approach focused on replicating formulas. But I soon realized the need for more versatile logic to handle various calculations beyond basic formulas, such as finding quartiles. This involved creating code that could adapt to different scenarios.
- **Efficient Unique Mode Printing:**  Finding the mode (most frequent value) was straightforward. However, efficiently printing each unique mode value presented a challenge. I refined my approach to ensure proper and clear output.
- **Variable Initialization:** Uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected results. I addressed this by initializing variables to appropriate values (often 0.0 (as I used double datatype) for numerical variables) before using them in calculations. This ensured accurate calculations and prevented errors.
