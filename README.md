# Statistical_Data_Analysis_Program
This C program performs statistical data analysis. I created it as part of a personal logic-building challenge. The program allows users to instantly calculate various statistical measures, including Absolute measures of dispersion, Relative measures of dispersion, Measures of Skewness and Kurtosis, Linear correlation and Regression analysis.
